# Yiban Login Demo

A demo showcasing the `yibanchen-react-login` library

To get started with the demo, you only need to install the dependencies from **package.json** by running `npm install` command.

You can see how the **login button** enables users to sign in with their Substrate/Polkadot wallet works, in addition to how to change an account using the **dropdown menu**.

You will also see what the process of **signing** and **verifying** your account looks like.

The demo will present a **modal window** if the `Polkadot browser extension` is not installed.
